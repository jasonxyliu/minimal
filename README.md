# Revised personal webpage template based on Minimal Theme
All changes were made in [index.html](https://github.com/jasonxyliu/minimal/blob/master/index.html).

Icons use font awesome (e.g. fa-github, fa-twitter) and academicons (e.g. ai-cv, ai-google-scholar).

Please upload files (e.g. paper pdfs, images) to proper folders, then replce links in the index.html.

Also replace embedded links to external websites, like Google Scholar and Twitter.

Please be aware of the security vulnerability of <code>target="_blank"</code>, use it with <code>rel="noopener noreferrer"</code>, as done in index.html.

Old [index.html](https://github.com/jasonxyliu/minimal/blob/master/legacy/index.html) from Minimal is in legacy folder. Many useful html syntaxes there.

**TODO**: add navigation bars below icons.
